# EncryptionProject
Our project involved developing encryption and decryption algorithms in Python using both a standard method (DES, AES, Blowfish, Twofish) and a custom algorithm. We encrypted and decrypted images, text files, zip files, and PowerPoints. Documentation covered our chosen method, its pros and cons, and details of our custom algorithm.
